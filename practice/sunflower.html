    <h1>The Sunflower Friend</h1>
    <div>
      Once upon a time, there was a little girl named
      <span class="highlight">Lily</span>. She had a unique friend, a
      <span class="green-highlight">sunflower</span>. Every day,
      <span class="highlight"> Lily</span> would talk to the
      <span class="green-highlight">sunflower</span> and share her dreams.
      <br />One day, the <span class="green-highlight">sunflower</span> seemed
      to be drooping. <span class="highlight"> Lily</span> was worried. She
      gently watered it and said, "You are my best friend, and I will always
      take care of you."
    </div>
    <h2>A Special Bond</h2>
    <div>
      <span class="highlight"> Lily</span> Lily and the
      <span class="green-highlight">sunflower</span> grew together. The
      <span class="green-highlight">sunflower</span> always stood tall, and
      <span class="highlight"> Lily</span> Lily felt the magic of care and
      friendship.
