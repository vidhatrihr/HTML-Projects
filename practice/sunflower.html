    <h1>The Sunflower Friend</h1>
    <div>
      Once upon a time, there was a little girl named
      <span class="highlight">Lily</span>. She had a unique friend, a sunflower.
      Every day, Lily would talk to the sunflower and share her dreams.
      <br />One day, the sunflower seemed to be drooping. Lily was worried. She
      gently watered it and said, "You are my best friend, and I will always
      take care of you."
    </div>
    <h2>A Special Bond</h2>
    <div>
      Lily and the sunflower grew together. The sunflower always stood tall, and
      Lily felt the magic of care and friendship.
